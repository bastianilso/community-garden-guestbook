# community-garden-guestbook
A digital guestbook interface to enable visitors to leave text and messages in community gardens.

Supports taking pictures using the frontfacing camera and text input using an on-screen keyboard.
The interface also connects to a sensor (WEMOS D1 Mini) to collect data about visitor entries. The sensor firmware can be found in the activitysensor/ folder.
Submitted entries appear on a vertical timeline, sorted by date.

The Project requires Unity 5.5.2.x and is written in C Sharp.
